# Sonitus
Noise-controls like **native**, but for _non-Apple_ devices.  
Simply select your device and you're ready to go.

&nbsp;

## Known supported headphones/earbuds:
### Sony:
- WH-1000XM3 / WH-1000XM4
- WF-1000XM4
- WI-C600N
### Bose:
- Bose QC35
- Bose NC700
### Anker Soundcore:

Let me know if your device is supported but I haven't put it on the list yet :)  
Would you like to see other headphones supported as well? Open an issue (or open a pull request), or DM me on Twitter.

## Does it work with other noise cancellation tweaks?
Yes! Sonitus should work just fine with other noise cancellation (automation) tweaks, because it emulates the behavior of the official Airpods pro.

## What is the difference between Sonitus and Sonyfy?
For the most part, Sonitus is a drop-in replacement for Sonyfy (for Sony headphones). The only difference is that Sonitus communicates directly with the headphones and doesn't need the app to be active in the background, so you would experience better battery life using Sonitus. And Sonitus supports more devices.
